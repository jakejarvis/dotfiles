# My .files 🏡

Just a personal backup of my MacBook's setup. Certainly not a drop-in solution for anybody's machine except my own, but maybe a few lines will prove useful to you. 

(...in other words, after stealing so many sick bash hacks from people on here who are much smarter than me, I felt obligated to keep the repo public.)

❤️ Jake
